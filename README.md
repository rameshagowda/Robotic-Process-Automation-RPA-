# Robotic-Process-Automation-RPA-
Automation of desktop, web, mainframe and citrix based application using RPA tools such as BluePrism, PegaRobotics, Automaton Anywhere and UiPath.
These applications should be rule based, structured and manual.

Note - RPA tools are not available for free.

Important features and PROs / CONs of market standard RPA tools:

Application Modeller:		

# Pega Robotics / Openspan:

# Pros
1. Great RPA tool for both RDA and RPA. RDA is assisted automation where Agent an Bot work together. It requires a design of user interface.
2. Integrated with Visual studio and great if you have DotNet/C# experience.
3. Framework components like Logging,  runtime configuration (read dynamic values from  xml)  can be built as C# DLL / custom conrols and import it to openspan studio.
4. Text adapter/Emulator for mainframe support
5. TFS integration

# Cons
1. Non Visual studio .Net developers find it difficult.
2. Localized credential staorage in flat file.
3. Inbuilt work queues not available 

# Important Elements of PegaRobotics/Openspan
Robotic Desktop Automation (RDA) support by adding windows forms
Adapters (Web, Desktop, Text and Citrix)
Global Container, Activities and Interaction manager to pass data back and forth between projects
